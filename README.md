# Dark mode (Pure CSS)
Exact source code taken from Aral Balkan's excellent guide on how to implement dark mode via CSS.

I have some mixed feelings. Although this might be a quick solution for large websites, there are greater nuances in crafting a visually realistic dark mode appearance, such as depth, hierachy, and contrast. In addition, dark mode is only activated when system-level dark mode is enabled. That said, I love how Aral uses the handy ```filter:invert;``` CSS property to swap around the colours. It's worth noting that chrome://dino also uses this same technique!
